  dialogText: For the first ten minutes of the hour, there was some kind of commotion
    going on in the center area with loud shouting and glass shattering. I was too
    busy to pay attention given I was filling in as a caterer with preparing dinner
    which came right after. Did I just want the food to come out faster? Possibly.
